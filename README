NAME
    Dancer::Plugin::DBIC - DBIx::Class interface for Dancer applications

VERSION
    version 0.1700

SYNOPSIS
        use Dancer;
        use Dancer::Plugin::DBIC 'schema';

        get '/users/:id' => sub {
            my $user = schema->resultset('User')->find(param 'id');
            template user_profile => {
                user => $user
            };
        };

        dance;

DESCRIPTION
    This plugin makes it very easy to create Dancer applications that
    interface with databases. It automatically exports the keyword "schema"
    which returns a DBIx::Class::Schema object. You just need to configure
    your database connection information. For performance, schema objects
    are cached in memory and are lazy loaded the first time they are
    accessed.

CONFIGURATION
    Configuration can be done in your Dancer config file. This is a minimal
    example. It defines one database named "default":

        plugins:
          DBIC:
            default:
              dsn: dbi:SQLite:dbname=some.db

    In this example, there are 2 databases configured named "default" and
    "foo":

        plugins:
          DBIC:
            default:
              dsn: dbi:SQLite:dbname=some.db
              schema_class: MyApp::Schema
            foo:
              dsn: dbi:mysql:foo
              schema_class: Foo::Schema
              user: bob
              pass: secret
              options:
                RaiseError: 1
                PrintError: 1

    Each database configured must at least have a dsn option. The dsn option
    should be the DBI driver connection string. All other options are
    optional.

    If you only have one schema configured, or one of them is named
    "default", you can call "schema" without an argument to get the only or
    "default" schema, respectively.

    If a schema_class option is not provided, then
    DBIx::Class::Schema::Loader will be used to dynamically load the schema
    by introspecting the database corresponding to the dsn value. Remember
    that you need DBIx::Class::Schema::Loader installed to take advantage of
    that.

    The schema_class option, should be a proper Perl package name that
    Dancer::Plugin::DBIC will use as a DBIx::Class::Schema class.
    Optionally, a database configuation may have user, pass, and options
    parameters as described in the documentation for "connect()" in DBI.

    You may also declare your connection information in the following format
    (which may look more familiar to DBIC users):

        plugins:
          DBIC:
            default:
              connect_info:
                - dbi:mysql:foo
                - bob
                - secret
                -
                  RaiseError: 1
                  PrintError: 1

USAGE
    This plugin provides just the keyword "schema" which returns a
    DBIx::Class::Schema object ready for you to use. If you have configured
    only one database, then you can call "schema" with no arguments:

        my $user = schema->resultset('User')->find('bob');

    If you have configured multiple databases, you can still call "schema"
    with no arguments if there is a database named "default" in the
    configuration. Otherwise, you must provide "schema()" with the name of
    the database:

        my $user = schema('foo')->resultset('User')->find('bob');

SCHEMA GENERATION
    There are two approaches for generating schema classes. You may generate
    your own DBIx::Class classes and set the corresponding "schema_class"
    setting in your configuration as shown above. This is the recommended
    approach for performance and stability.

    It is also possible to have schema classes dynamically generated if you
    omit the "schema_class" configuration setting. This requires you to have
    DBIx::Class::Schema::Loader installed. The "v7" naming scheme will be
    used for naming the auto generated classes. See "naming" in
    DBIx::Class::Schema::Loader::Base for more information about naming.

    For generating your own schema classes, you can use the dbicdump command
    line tool provided by DBIx::Class::Schema::Loader to help you. For
    example, if your app were named Foo, then you could run the following
    from the root of your project directory:

        dbicdump -o dump_directory=./lib Foo::Schema dbi:SQLite:/path/to/foo.db

    For that example, your "schema_class" setting would be "Foo::Schema".
